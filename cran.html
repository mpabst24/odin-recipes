        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the best fudge recipe ever! It's my aunt's recipe, passed down through the family. It's better than any fudge I've ever had at the Jersey shore and easy enough to whip up in 15 minutes or so.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme</li>
            <li>⅔ cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups milk chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped nuts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
